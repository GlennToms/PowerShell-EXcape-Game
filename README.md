This is Reiner Knizia's answer to venerable gamer designer Sid Sackson's Can't Stop. For a turn, a player rolls two dice. The die results are used to create a two digit number, like sixty-five or twenty-two. If the result is a double, you can move your marker forward. However, you can continue re-rolling your dice if the result isn't high enough. Assuming you haven't ended your turn by rolling any of the X's on the dice, then you can 'bid' the results of your dice for movement. If no one's beat your bid by the time it is your turn again, then you move your token that many spaces.
